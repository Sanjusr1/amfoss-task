  - The Emperor calls for help ,when Chaos is taking over ,and heretics are emerging .Since some of our fellow space marine has been stranded on a desolate planet “Arrakis-dex”, with nothing but a handbook and an imperial plasma gun with them ,with the courage and strength of an astarte having, they can even survive the hostile yet lifeless prison .
Through each part of this challenge , u will get to solve many different puzzles , and engaged in a battle against the chaos of the universe

## Part 0

- In this part you will get fimilarise with basic terminal and git commands in a fun way .
- so in this first we will git clone our local repository ,by using "git clone".
- Then we will create a handbook with the help of nano or any other text editior .
- To get into part-1 we need to use 'cd' command 
  cd Terminal-Chaos/Arrakis-dex.
  
## Part 1

In this part:
 -  With the help of 'ls' command we can find all the files listed in Terminal-Chaos / Arrakis-dex directory .
 - Since it's given that we need to go somewhere where there is roof above our head , I chose Eolian Caves as my directory, and as we go in ..
- we encounter a hidden tunnel , and to light that up we need a parchment , after finding parchment with the help of 'cat' command we can read what is there in it , and a new code is unlocked in it and the code is

  -  CODE: aHR0cHM6Ly9naXRo
- And we can use tree for guidance .
  
## Part 2

- In this we need to change our realm first and to do that we use 'git switch < The- realm/branch >' and to check out in which realm /branch we are in , we use 'git checkout'
- And after changing into or switching into other realm we need to prepare a holy spell , and to do that we need to find the filenames of herbs together which have both "holy" and "good" inside their content.
- After that we will find 2 names which satisfy those conditions and after finding those 2 names we need to join those 2 names together , the oo word should be first and replace the each letter from this combination with the letter previous one and at last rovemove all the vowels from final code ,then u will get a holy spell made by you
  
     - And the holy spell is: LnnmknnlLhrsdhk
       
-After getting holy spell use that to defeat Kharnok the Bloodforged , and to that in terminal open python file of Kharnok the Bloodforged and enter holy spell when they asks you to 
- After clearing that part you will get access to Celestial Veil Amulet and Light book
- After getting access to Celestial Veil Amulet , switch into Dark realm 1 and use 'cat' command to read the new code that is present in Celestial Veil Amulet
     
     - CODE:CSigVmaroAn
