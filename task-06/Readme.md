## Snakes-And-Ladders
### Overview:
This is a classic board game which is also everyone's one of their favoutate game,and most of them knows to play,but now we play this game a little bit differently in this app.
In this we can create and delete useless moves from the game also.

### Features:
#### Game Board:

  - Grid Layout: The board is usually a square grid, commonly 10x10, making 100 squares. Each square is numbered from 1 to 100.
    Design: The squares often have a colorful and engaging design, with illustrations of snakes, ladders, and sometimes thematic decorations.

#### Snakes:

  - Positioning: Snakes are drawn on the board connecting higher-numbered squares to lower-numbered ones.
    Effect: Landing on a snake's head causes the player to slide down to the square at the snake's tail, effectively sending the player backward on the board.

#### Ladders:

-  Positioning: Ladders are placed on the board connecting lower-numbered squares to higher-numbered ones.
    Effect: Landing on the base of a ladder allows the player to climb up to the top of the ladder, advancing forward on the board.

#### Dice:

-  Usage: Players roll a single die (or two dice in some variations) to determine how many spaces they move on their turn.
    Outcome: The number rolled dictates the movement from the current position.

#### Players:

  - Pieces: Each player has a distinct piece or token to represent their position on the board.
  -  Objective: The main goal is to reach the final square (usually 100) before the other players.

#### Start and Finish:

  - Starting Point: All players typically start from square 1.
   -  Winning: The first player to reach the final square, 100, wins the game. In some versions, the exact number on the die is required to land on square 100.

#### Rules:

-  Basic Movement: Players move their piece forward based on the die roll.
 -   Snakes and Ladders: When landing on a snake or ladder, players follow the boardâ€™s design to move up or down accordingly.

#### Variations:

  - Thematic Versions: Some versions of the game have different themes, like educational or pop culture versions, which may alter the appearance or rules slightly.
  -  Additional Rules: Some house rules may include specific actions for rolling doubles, or different ways to handle the end of the game.
